LONG DESCRIPTION
    The IPv4 Tools module enables a set of functions to assist with common IP Address administration tasks, including :
    - The ability to convert subnet masks between dotted decimal, CIDR, wildcard and binary.
    - The ability to calculate the resulting broadcast, network, wildcard mask and host range based upon an entered IP address and netmask.
    - The ability to validate an IPv4 address.
    - The ability to generate an array of IP Addresses based on a start and end address.
    - The ability to display current ARP entries.

EXAMPLES
    Convert-SubnetMask -Netmask 255.255.0.0
    Convert-SubnetMask -CIDR 24
    Get-IPv4Calculation -IPv4Address 10.10.100.5/24
    Test-IPv4Address -IPv4Address 192.168.0.1
    New-IPRange -StartIPv4Address 192.168.0.1 -EndIPv4Address 192.168.10.254
    Get-ARPCache
